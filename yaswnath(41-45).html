<i>In this chapter, I discuss the problem of feature subset selection for supervised inductive
learning approaches to knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), and examine this
and related problems in the context of controlling inductive bias. I survey several
combinatorial search and optimization approaches to this problem, focusing on data-
driven, validation-based techniques. In particular, I present a wrapper approach that
uses genetic algorithms for the search component, using a validation criterion based
upon model accuracy and problem complexity, as the fitness measure. Next, I focus on
design and configuration of high-level optimization systems (wrappers) for relevance
determination and constructive induction, and on integrating these wrappers with
elicited knowledge on attribute relevance and synthesis. I then discuss the relationship
between this model selection criterion and those from the minimum description length
(MDL) family of learning criteria. I then present results on several synthetic problems</i><br><br>


<i>on task-decomposable machine learning and on two large-scale commercial data-mining and decision-support projects: crop condition monitoring, and loss prediction
for insurance pricing. Finally, I report experiments using the </i> Learning in Java
(MLJ) <i>and</i> Data to Knowledge (D2K) <i></i> visual programming systems for data
mining and information visualization, and several commercial and research tools. Test
set accuracy using a genetic wrapper is significantly higher than that of decision tree
inducers alone and is comparable to that of the best extant search-space based
wrappers.</i><br><br>
<div class="center1"><center>INTRODUCTION</center></div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter introduces the problems for change of representation (Benjamin, 1990)
in supervised inductive learning. I address the focal problem of inductive learning in data
mining and present a multi-strategy framework for automatically improving the representation of learning problems. This framework incorporates methodological aspects of
<i>feature subset selection and feature (attribute) partitioning, automated problem
decomposition, and model selection.</i> The focus is on<i> wrapper-based </i>methods as
studied in recent and continuing research.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, I present a new metric-based model selection approach (composite
learning) for decomposable learning tasks. The type of data for which this approach is
best suited is heterogeneous, time series data &#45; that arising from multiple sources of data
(as in sensor fusion or multimodal human-computer interaction tasks, for example). The
rationale for applying multi-strategy learning to such data is that, by systematic analysis
and transformation of learning tasks, both the efficiency and accuracy of classifier
learning may be improved for certain time series problems. Such problems are referred
to in this chapter as <i>decomposable;</i> the methods addressed are: task decomposition and
subproblem definition, quantitative model selection, and construction of hierarchical
mixture models for data fusion. This chapter presents an integrated, multi-strategy
system for decomposition of time series classifier learning tasks.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical application for such a system is learning to predict and classify hazardous
and potentially catastrophic conditions. This prediction task is also known as <i>crisis
monitoring,</i> a form of pattern recognition that is useful in decision support or <i>recommender</i>
systems (Resnick & Varian, 1997) for many time-critical applications. Examples of crisis
monitoring problems in the industrial, military, agricultural, and environmental sciences
are numerous. They include: crisis control automation (Hsu<i> et al.,</i> 1998), online medical
diagnosis (Hayes-Roth <i>et al., </i>1996), simulation-based training and critiquing for crisis
management (Gaba <i>et al.,</i> 1992; Grois, Hsu, Voloshin, & Wilkins <i>et al., </i>1998), and
intelligent data visualization for <i>real-time decision-making </i>(Horvitz & Barry, 1995).<br><br>
<div class="center1">Motivation: Control of Inductive Bias</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad objectives of the approach I present here are to increase the robustness
of inductive machine learning algorithms and develop learning systems that can be
automatically tuned to meet the requirements of a knowledge discovery (KD) performance element. When developers of learning systems can map a KD application to a set<br><br>


of automatic higher-order parameter-turning problems, the reuse of design and code
embodied by this generalization over traditional learning can reduce development costs.
When addressing KD problems in computational science and engineering, the time
required to develop an effective representation and to tune these hyperparameters using
training and validation data sets can be a significant fraction of the development time of
the KD system, exceeding the time required to apply traditional learning algorithms with
fixed hyperparameters and bias parameters. This setting introduces new flexibility and
complexity into the learning problem and may extend the expected useful lifetime of the
system. For example, if the learning component is made more adaptable through
automated performance tuning, then the overall system, not merely the learning algorithms it uses, may last longer than one tailored to a specific data set or problem domain.
Thus it becomes subject to traditional maintenance and evolution. On the other hand,
performance tuning may reduce the development time of highly specialized KD systems
as well, by identifying and constructing relevant variables. In this case, reducing the cost
of developing the more limited-use software can, in turn, significantly reduce that of
solving the intended scientific or engineering problem. In many real-world KD applica-tions, it is preferable to automatically tune some but not all of the available bias
parameters to prevent overfitting of training data. This is because the computational time
savings for the performance element (e.g., prediction, classification, or pattern detection
function) and marginal gains in solution quality (e.g., utility or accuracy) do not make it
worthwhile to fine-tune some bias parameters that are less significant for the learning
problem. A significant component of development costs is related to reducing wasted
development time and computation time by making the entire programming systems
product (Brooks, 1995) responsive and adaptable to end-user needs. Combinatorial
search and statistical validation over representations, visualization of the models and
their relation to quantitative inductive bias (Benjamin, 1990; Mitchell, 1997), and highlevel user interfaces for KD can be applied to achieve these goals.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major motivation for the automation of problem transformation is <i>transparency.</i>
The end user of a KD system is often a specialist in scientific, engineering, or businessrelated technical fields other than intelligent systems and machine learning. He or she
knows the requirements of the application in terms of the performance element, an
analytical function that can: predict the continuation of a historical time series; detect
anomalous conditions in a time annotated episodic log; classify, diagnose, or explain set
of database records; make a recommendation for a business or medical decision; or
generate a plan, schedule, or design. These predictors, anomaly detectors, classifiers,
diagnostic and recommender systems, policies, and other problem solvers have their own
performance measures, perhaps including real-time requirements, which in turn dictate
those of the learning system. This suggests that more robust KD may be achieved by
letting the end user specify requirements pertaining to the performance element and
automatically generating specifications for the desired representation and higher-order
parameters to be tuned. In this way, the improvement of problem representation by
automated transformation can be driven by users&#146; specified time and resource constraints.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research covered in this chapter focuses on demonstrating, through development of a learning enhancement framework and through empirical evaluation, that these
broad objectives can be achieved for a wide variety of real-world KD applications. This
research thrust has two main objectives: assessing the breadth of applicability of<br><br>



automatic transformation of learning problems by training the resultant models and
applying them to large-scale KD problems over real-world data sets, and developing
information visualization techniques to help users understand this process of improving
problem representations.<br><br>
<div class="center1">Attribute-Driven Problem Decomposition: Subset<br>
Selection and Partition Search</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many techniques have been studied for decomposing learning tasks, to obtain
more tractable subproblems, and to apply multiple models for reduced variance. This
section examines <i>attribute-based </i>approaches for problem reformulation, especially
<i>partitioning</i> of input attributes in order to define <i>intermediate concepts</i> (Fu & Buchanan,
1985) in problem decomposition. This mechanism produces multiple subproblems for
which appropriate models must be selected; the trained models can then be combined
using <i>classifier fusion</i> models adapted from bagging (Breiman, 1996), boosting (Freund
& Schapire, 1996), stacking (Wolpert, 1992), and hierarchical mixture models (Jordan &
Jacobs, 1994).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the approaches we shall examine in this chapter uses partitioning to
<i>decompose</i> a learning task into parts that are individually useful (using <i>aggregation </i>as
described in the background section of this chapter), rather than to <i>reduce</i> attributes to
a single useful group. This permits new intermediate concepts to be formed by
unsupervised learning methods such as conceptual clustering (Michalski & Stepp, 1983)
or cluster formation using self-organizing algorithms (Kohonen, 1990; Hsu<i> et al.,</i> 2002).
The newly defined problem or problems can then be mapped to one or more appropriate
hypothesis languages (model specifications). In our new system, the subproblem
definitions obtained by partitioning of attributes also specify a mixture estimation
problem (i.e., data fusion step occurs after training of the models for all the subproblems).<br><br>
<div class="center1">Subproblem Definition</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of attribute partitioning is to define intermediate concepts and
subtasks of decomposable time series learning tasks, which can be mapped to the
appropriate submodels. In both attribute subset selection and partitioning, attributes
are grouped into subsets that are relevant to a particular task: the overall learning task
or a subtask. Each subtask for a partitioned attribute set has its own inputs (the attribute
subset) and its own <i>intermediate concept.</i> This intermediate concept can be discovered
using unsupervised learning methods, such as self-organizing feature maps (Kohonen,
1990; Hsu <i>et al., </i>2002) and <i>k-means clustering</i> (Duda <i>et al.,</i> 2000). Other methods, such
as <i>competitive clustering</i> or <i>vector quantization</i> using radial basis functions (Haykin,
1999), <i>neural trees</i> (Li <i>et al.,</i> 1993) and similar models (Ray & Hsu, 1998; Duda <i>et al.,</i> 2000),
<i>principal components analysis </i>(Watanabe, 1985; Haykin, 1999), <i>Karhunen-Loève
transforms </i>(Watanabe, 1985), or <i>factor analysis </i>(Watanabe, 1985), can also be used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attribute partitioning is used to control the formation of intermediate concepts in
this system. Whereas attribute subset selection yields a<i> single,</i> reformulated learning
problem (whose intermediate concept is neither necessarily nor intentionally different<br><br>


from the original concept), attribute partitioning yields <i>multiple learning subproblems</i>
(whose intermediate concepts may or may not differ, but are simpler by design when they
do). The goal of this approach is to find a natural and principled way to specify how
intermediate concepts should be simpler than the overall concept.<br><br>
<div class="center1">Metric-Based Model Selection and Composite<br>
Learning</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Model selection</i> is the problem of choosing a hypothesis class that has the
appropriate complexity for the given training data (Stone, 1977; Schuurmans, 1997).
Quantitative methods for model selection have previously been used to learn using
highly flexible <i>nonparametric</i> models with many degrees of freedom, but with no
particular assumptions on the structure of decision surfaces.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to decompose a learning task into simpler subproblems prefigures a need
to map these subproblems to the appropriate models. The general mapping problem,
broadly termed <i>model selection, </i>can be addressed at very minute to very coarse levels.
This chapter examines quantitative, metric-based approaches for model selection at a
coarse level. This approach is a direct extension of the <i>problem definition and technique
selection </i>process (Engels <i>et al., </i>1998). We will henceforth use the term <i>model selection</i>
to refer to both traditional model selection and the metric-based methods for technique
selection as presented here. We begin with background on the general framework of
inductive bias control and then survey time series learning architectures, their <i>representation biases</i> (Witten & Frank, 2000), and methods for selecting them from a collection
of model components.<br><br>
<div class="center1"><center>BACKGROUND</center></div>
<div class="center1">Key Problem: Automated Control of Inductive Bias</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first focus on development of a new learning system for spatiotemporal KD. The
KD performance element in this problem is not just analytical but includes decision
support through model visualization and anomaly detection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems we face are threefold and are surveyed in the above sections on
current and related work. First, we must address <i>relevance determination</i> to determine
what sensor data channels are useful for a particular KD objective and data set. This
problem is related to the so-called <i>curse of dimensionality</i> wherein an overabundance
of input variables makes it difficult to learn the prediction, classification, or pattern
recognition element. Second, the task of identifying hyperparameters of the KD system
is subject to deceptivity and instability because bias optimization in general introduces
a new level of combinatorial complexity to the problem of inductive learning. Third, the
very large spatiotemporal databases we are dealing with are highly heterogeneous,
arising from many disparate sources such as global positioning systems (GPS), survey-ing, sensors such as radar, and historical databases; this heterogeneity presents the
advantage of type information that can help constrain dimensionality but also aggra-<br>
